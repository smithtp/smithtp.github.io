My research combines a variety of techniques, from laboratory and field experiments, to bioinformatics and mathematical modelling, in order to understand how microbial
populations and communities respond and adapt to changing environments. Much of my work has also used these data as a basis for predictions of how ecosystem 
functioning and carbon storage may vary due to global climate change. In particular my research has been focused on the effects of environmental stressors on the functioning 
and dynamics of microbial populations, however recently I have also investigated the effects of climate on COVID-19 transmission rates. Some highlights from past and ongoing projects are shown below.

<h1>Main Research Areas</h1> 

<h2>Evolutionary dynamics of bacterial communities in the wild</h2>

</p>

<p>
  Most studies of bacterial evolutionary dynamics are constrained to monoculture lab experiments. However, in the wild these organisms live in complex assemblages of interacting species.
  Therefore when investigating evolutionary responses of bacteria to abiotic changes, we must also consider the biotic context of the communities within which they are embedded.
</p>

<p>
  Here, we are perturbing the environment of tree-holes (natural pools of rainwater that form in Beech trees) in Wytham Woods. 
  We are using metagenomic approaches to investigate the relative importance of genetic adaptation, dispersal, and sorting of latent diversity in the responses of
  tree-hole bacterial communities to environmental change.

<h2>Effects of Multiple Chemical Stressors on Microbial Populations</h2>

</p>

<p>
Freshwater ecosystems are under an increasing array of threats, especially from a wide range of new and emerging chemical stressors. 
These ecosystems are underpinned by microbes, which perform key ecosystem functions and services. 
Therefore, understanding the impacts of chemical stressors on freshwater microbes is key to understanding their impacts at the ecosystem level. 
We are testing the impacts of chemical stressors in freshwater mesocosms, however this is labour intensive and limited in the number of chemical combinations that can be tested. 
</p>

<p>
By contrast, the limits of chemical testing in the lab can be orders of magnitude higher than in the field. Here in the lab, 
we are testing the effects of a large array of replicated mixtures of chemicals on microbes and microbial communities, to provide a vast database 
of first responses to chemicals and to answer fundamental questions about interactions among chemical stressors.

<h2>Microbial Thermal Ecology and Evolution</h2>

Bacteria and archaea (collectively "prokaryotes") are globally ubiquitous and may
comprise in the region of half of the Earth's total biomass. Understanding how these
diverse micro-organisms are affected by temperature is therefore key to our understanding
of the impacts of climate change on ecosystem functioning.
</p>

<p>
My work on this broad topic can be roughly divided into two main aspects. Firstly,
investigating how the evolution and adaptation of microbial metabolic rates is
constrained by temperature, within the framework of Ecological Metabolic Theory. Secondly,
understanding how changes in temperature may affect the composition of microbial communities
and the impacts that these changes may have on ecosystem functioning.

Given its similar structure to other viruses that display seasonal dynamics, it has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent of COVID-19)
should display similar responses to environmental factors, with transmission rates peaking in winter. We investigated this potential
seasonality, by incorporating environmental parameters into epidemiological models of viral transmission. Our findings suggest a role for
the environment, but only when human mobility is not restricted through policy or behaviour.

Bdelloid rotifers are a bizarre group of anciently asexual microscopic animals, dubbed
an evolutionary "scandal". In order to be successful over an evolutionary time-scale in
the absence of sexual recombination, bdelloid rotifers appear to have incorporated an 
unusually high number of foreign genes into their genomes, via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). 
My involvement in understanding this process began with working to produce a genome for
one rotifer species, *Rotaria magnacalcarata*, and then mapping putative HGT genes (previously
identified via transcriptomics) to the genome assembly in order to confirm their presence.
