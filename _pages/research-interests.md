My research combines a variety of techniques, from laboratory experiments to bioinformatics and mathematical modelling, to understand how organisms,
populations and communities respond and adapt to changing environments. Some highlights from past and ongoing projects are shown below.

Bacteria and archaea (collectively "prokaryotes") are globally ubiquitous and may
comprise in the region of half of the Earth's total biomass. Understanding how these
diverse micro-organisms are affected by temperature is therefore key to our understanding
of the impacts of climate change.
  
My work on this broad topic can be roughly divided into two main aspects. Firstly,
investigating how the evolution and adaptation of microbial metabolic rates is
constrained by temperature, within the framework of Ecological Metabolic Theory. Secondly,
understanding how changes in temperature may affect the composition of microbial communities
and the impacts that these changes may have on ecosystem functioning.

Bdelloid rotifers are a bizarre group of anciently asexual microscopic animals, dubbed
an evolutionary "scandal". In order to be successful over an evolutionary time-scale in
the absence of sexual recombination, bdelloid rotifers appear to have incorporated an 
unusually high number of foreign genes into their genomes, via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). 
My involvement in understanding this process began with working to produce a genome for
one rotifer species, *Rotaria magnacalcarata*, and then mapping putative HGT genes (previously
identified via transcriptomics) to the genome assembly in order to confirm their presence.

This was with Prof. Tim Barraclough's group - [barralab](http://barralab.bio.ic.ac.uk/).
