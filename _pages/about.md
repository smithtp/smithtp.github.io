I'm a recent PhD graduate from Imperial College London, broadly interested in ecology and evolution in the context of environmental change. My PhD research involved looking
at how micro-organisms respond and adapt to temperature change, understanding the basic principles of temperature responses as well 
as the ecological implications of thermal adaptaion. 

My PhD work was supervised by [Dr. Samraat Pawar (ecoinformatics)](https://mhasoba.pythonanywhere.com/pawarlab/default/index "Pawar Lab") 
and [Prof. Tom Bell (microbial ecology)](https://bellmicrobelab.wordpress.com "Bell Lab").

I am currently hoping to continue to work in microbial ecology and evolution via a postdoc position.
