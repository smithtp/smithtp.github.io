I am a postdoctoral research associate, broadly interested in ecology and evolution in the context of environmental change. I'm currently working with 
[Dr. Will Pearse](http://pearselab.com/ "Pearse Lab") at Imperial College London, where we are investigating the role of environmental factors
in COVID-19 transmission rates.

The final piece left over from my PhD work is now available as a preprint: ["Latent functional diversity may accelerate microbial community responses to environmental fluctuations."](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.14.439774v1)

We performed a species sorting experiment to uncover the latent diversity in microbial thermal fitness present in soil. We find that strains with different life history traits switch on under different thermal conditons.
In particular, we see a difference in the temperatures where r- and K- specialist taxa are obtained from. This shows that microbial community function is likely to respond rapidly to changes in the environment, 
via species sorting acting upon the broad diversity present within communities.

Second COVID pre-print out on the UK VOC: ["Environmental drivers of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 transmission intensity."](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.09.21253242v2)

We found that, similar to our work on COVID-19 transmission in the USA, transmission of the UK "Variant of Concern" (VOC; lineage B.1.1.7) was affected by temperature and population density when full "lockdown" was not in place.
We also found a transmission advantage over other strains in warmer conditions - concerning for B.1.1.7's invasion of Europe through the spring and summer.
