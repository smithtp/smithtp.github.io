I am a postdoctoral research associate, broadly interested in ecology and evolution in the context of environmental change. I'm currently working with 
[Dr. Will Pearse](http://pearselab.com/ "Pearse Lab") at Imperial College London, where we are investigating the role of environmental factors
in COVID-19 transmission rates.

Our COVID PNAS paper was referred to in a *Guardian* article about weather and COVID transmission: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/20/does-warm-weather-mean-you-are-less-likely-to-catch-covid](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/20/does-warm-weather-mean-you-are-less-likely-to-catch-covid)

Our bacterial carbon use efficiency paper has been published in Ecology Letters: ["Systematic variation in the temperature dependence of bacterial carbon used efficiency."](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.13840)

We found that bacterial CUE tends to respond positively or be invariant to temperature. This is contrary to how microbial CUE is often paramaterised in biogeochemical models.

Our first COVID paper is out in PNAS: ["Temperature and population density influence SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the absence of nonpharmaceutical interventions."](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/25/e2019284118)

We found that temperature and population density can have a significant impact on the transmission rate of COVID-19, but only when non-pharmaceutical policy interventions are not in place. 
When measures are in place to restrict human movement, environmental effects are negated.
