I am a postdoctoral research associate, broadly interested in ecology and evolution in the context of environmental change. I'm currently working with 
[Dr. Will Pearse](http://pearselab.com/ "Pearse Lab") at Imperial College London, where we are investigating the role of environmental factors
in COVID-19 transmission rates.

Second COVID pre-print out on the UK VOV: ["Environmental drivers of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 transmission intensity."](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.09.21253242v2)

We found that, similar to our work on COVID-19 transmission in the USA, transmission of the UK "Variant of Concern" (VOC; lineage B.1.1.7) was affected by temperature and population density when full "lockdown" was not in place.
We also found a transmission advantage over other strains in warmer conditions - concerning for B.1.1.7's invasion of Europe through the spring and summer.
