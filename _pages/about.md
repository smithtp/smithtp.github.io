I am a postdoctoral research associate, broadly interested in ecology and evolution in the context of environmental change. I'm currently working with 
[Dr. Will Pearse](http://pearselab.com/ "Pearse Lab") at Imperial College London, where we are investigating the role of environmental factors
in COVID-19 transmission rates.

Our first COVID paper is out in PNAS: ["Temperature and population density influence SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the absence of nonpharmaceutical interventions."](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/25/e2019284118)

We found that temperature and population density can have a significant impact on the transmission rate of COVID-19, but only when non-pharmaceutical policy interventions are not in place. 
When measures are in place to restrict human movement, environmental effects are negated.
