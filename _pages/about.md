I am a postdoctoral research associate, broadly interested in ecology and evolution in the context of environmental change. I'm currently based in 
[Professor Tom Bell's lab](https://bellmicrobelab.wordpress.com "Bell Lab") at Imperial College London, where we are investigating the impacts of
chemical stressors on microbes and microbial commmunities.
