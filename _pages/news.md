Second paper from my PhD available as a preprint: ["Systematic variation in the temperature dependence of bacterial carbon use efficiency."](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.14.296095v1)

We found that bacterial CUE tends to respond positively or be invariant to temperature. This is contrary to how microbial CUE is often paramaterised in biogeochemical models.

First COVID pre-print from the Pearse lab: ["Environment influences SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the absence of non-pharmaceutical interventions."](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.12.20193250v1)

We found that temperature and population density can have a significant impact on the transmission rate of COVID-19, but only when non-pharmaceutical policy interventions are not in place. 
When measures are in place to restrict human movement, any effect of environment is much decreased.
