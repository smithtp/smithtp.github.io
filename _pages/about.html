I am a postdoctoral research associate, broadly interested in microbial ecology and evolution in the context of environmental change. I'm currently working with 
<a href="https://bellmicrobelab.wordpress.com/">Prof. Tom Bell</a> at Imperial College London, where we are investigating the evolutionary dynamics of wild bacterial communities.

2022-12-05: Our paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.80867">"Latent functional diversity may accelerate microbial community responses to temperature fluctuations"</a> is out in eLife!

We found that changes in temperature can lead to the resuscitation of previously inactive species or strains, a potentially important mechanism for community responses to environmental change.
