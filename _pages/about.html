I am a postdoctoral research associate, broadly interested in microbial ecology and evolution in the context of environmental change. I'm currently working with 
<a href="https://bellmicrobelab.wordpress.com/">Prof. Tom Bell</a> at Imperial College London, where we are investigating the evolutionary dynamics of wild bacterial communities.

2025-05-02: Our new paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiaf047">"Phylogenetic clustering of microbial communities as a biomarker for chemical pollution"</a> is out in FEMS Microbiology Ecology! 

We found that microbial communities exposed to chemical pollutants which impacted bacterial growth also altered the community structure, making them more phylogenetically clustered. This opens up avenues for using microbial community metrics to diagnose disturbed ecosystems.

2024-10-18: I was invited to be a panellist on BBC Radio 4's "Rare Earth" programme, hosted by Tom Heap and Helen Czerski, for an episode all about the wondererful world of microbes.
