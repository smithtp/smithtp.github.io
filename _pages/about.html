I am a postdoctoral research associate, broadly interested in microbial ecology and evolution in the context of environmental change. I'm currently working with 
<a href="https://bellmicrobelab.wordpress.com/">Prof. Tom Bell</a> at Imperial College London, where we are investigating the evolutionary dynamics of wild bacterial communities.

By some miracle it won a prize for best poster!
