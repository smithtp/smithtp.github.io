I am a postdoctoral research associate, broadly interested in microbial ecology and evolution in the context of environmental change. I'm currently working with 
<a href="https://bellmicrobelab.wordpress.com/">Prof. Tom Bell</a> at Imperial College London, where we are investigating the evolutionary dynamics of wild bacterial communities.

2024-04-18: Our new paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-024-01626-9">"High-throughput characterization of bacterial responses to complex mixtures of chemical pollutants"</a> is out in Nature Microbiology!

We found that bacterial strains responded in different ways to the stressor mixtures, which could not be predicted simply from their phylogenetic relatedness.
We found that more complex chemical mixtures produced more negative impacts on bacterial growth, but also revealed more net interactions, with antagonisms most prevalent.
We found that a mixed culture of bacteria was more resilient to multiple stressors than individual isolates.
