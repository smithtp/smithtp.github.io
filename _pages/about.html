I am a postdoctoral research associate, broadly interested in microbial ecology and evolution in the context of environmental change. I'm currently working with 
<a href="https://bellmicrobelab.wordpress.com/">Prof. Tom Bell</a> at Imperial College London, where we are investigating the ecological dynamics of holobiont microbiome assembly.

<p>
I was awarded the BES Aquaic Ecology Early Career Researcher Prize for my recent work on aquatic microbial communities! I gave a talk at the meeting about microbes inhabiting tree holes - small puddles of water formed where the roots buttress up against the trunk of beech trees.

Also had a great time talking about our <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ismejo/wraf144">tree hole work</a> at the main BES conference in Edinburgh at the end of the year!
